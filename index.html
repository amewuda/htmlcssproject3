                <h1>OUR IDENTIFICATION IN CHRIST</h1>
                <p>
                    The backbone of Paul's preaching is the fact that we are participants in all that Jesus endured
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are crucified with Him</li>
                        <li>We died with Him</li>
                        <li>We were buried with Him</li>
                        <li>We were made alive with Him</li>
                        <li>We were raised with Him</li>
                        <li>We were seated with Him</li>
                        <li>We were anointed with Him</li>
                        <li>We were manifested with him</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have been identified with Christ in His finished work. <br>
                    This is a divine fact. They are Realities. They are ours. <br>
                    They were freely given to us in the grace of God, yet they must be fully possessed by aggressive faith.

                <h1>GET FINANCIALLY EDUCATED</h1>
                <p>
                    People who make money their masters are financially ignorant. Ignorance is the greatest jailer of destinies. <br>
                    There is truth about money and knwing that truth will set you free. Knowing the truth an applying it is what financial education is all about. <br>
                    Money does not make people rich. Knowledge sets them free from poverty to strive towards abundance. <br>
                    That someone receives a large amount as salary does not mean he is rich. The only time you will know if a person is rich is when he loses his money and all he is left with is his knowledge of ignorance. <br>
                    If you want to prosper you need to pursue knowledge and not money. Do business be an entrepreneur, acquire assets, save money and live frugally and give back to the world.

                <h1>SOLVING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS</h1>
                <p>
                    People become fulfilled and also rich on earth when they solve the problems of people. The more the people who have the problem, the richer the solution provider is. <br>
                    To most Christians, the problem is a sign of the devil in manifestation. When a problem occurs, they bind and loose, not knowing that the problem is the way to their riches. <br>
                    Dr. Myles Munroe once said that wherever there are problems, there are opportunities for wealth. the bigger the problem and the more prople are suffering under its yoke, the bigger and grwater the opportunity is to create wealth. <br>
                    If you are not solving problems you have no right to seek prosperity. God has equipped you with the power to turn problems into wealth and has given you all things that pertain to solving problems like God would have. <br>
                    The intersection of people's needs and the solution you provide is key determinant of your wealth. They do not need motivations, they need solutions. <br>
                    Make life better for people by solving their problems, get to know the pains, problems and challenges people are experiencing then develop solutions for them and deliver it to them. Add value to people's lives and they will reward you.

                <h1>
                    THE OPTIMIST
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <blockquote>The habit of looking on the bright side of things is worth far more than a thousand pounds a year - Samuel Johnson</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>More than half the unhappiness in the world comes from a person's unwillingness to look on the bright side so long as a dark side can be discovered</blockquote> </p>
                <p>
                    We all like the optimist. The bright, cheerful, good-natured fellow who always look through the cloud and sees its silver lining, is a good tonic to our most pessimistic dispositions. <br>
                    If then you wish to make yourself agreeable to others and to yourself, cultivate the HABIT OF CHEERFULNESS - of always looking at the bright side. <br>
                    Wear a pleasant countenance, let cheerfulness beam in your eye, let love write its amrk on your forehead and have kind words and a pleasant greeting for those whom you meet. <br>
                    Do not forget to say, "good morning!" and say it heartily. Pleasant, hearty greetings cheer the discouraged, rest the tired and make the wheels of life run more smoothly. they clear up the thorny pathways, win friends and confound enemies. <br>
                    In fact, it is impossible to resist the influence of cheerfulness.
